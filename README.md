dotfiles
========

My original dotfiles repo was pushed 7 years ago when I was running Arch Linux on an old 2013 Macbook. Since then, I had a long period of time where I was not doing any coding or development and have been using Windows.

Recently, I've had the opportunity to start coding again, and have been exploring the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Specifically, my current setup uses Windows 10 with Arch Linux installed the under WSL [unoffical](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL) running on Microsoft's [new open-source terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).

I set it up following along the instructions at [Hannu Hatikainen's blog](https://hannuhartikainen.fi/blog/arch-wsl/) steps 2-6. As `aurman` is no longer supported, I installed the `yay` aur helper, and I chose to make my default set up run `tmux` `vim` and `fish` shell. I'm using the plugin helpers `plug-vim`, `tpm` and `fisher` as these are the most straightforward plain-text options.
